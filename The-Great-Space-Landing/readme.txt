The Great Space Landing is a modifcation and improvment of the game Moon Lander on gametutorial.net. This is currently my first expedition into game frameworks, java UI and working with files that are not text-based files. A very fun and enlightening project if I do say so.

It is important to point out that it is taking me a few days to get all of this code cleaned up and noted up and properly stubbed out for features I would like to see in the future and that it is very much a work-in-progress. (see: mouse pointer stubs everywhere, options menu stubs, and GLORIOUS MS PAINT IMAGES.)
