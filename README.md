Directory search is a console application that searches a directory on your computer for files and displays the name of the file on screen. It uses recursion to delve deep into the darkest reaches of your computer to see what files match the search criteria.

Linked list fun is a program that populates a list of random numbers to a lenght of your choice and has a few features for adding, deleting, sorting and otherwise enjoying a list of random numbers. It uses bubble sort, which isn't terribly efficient.
